<!-- Internal Script -->

<!-- The internal script can be written in the head or the body, but it is preferred to put it on the body of the HTML document. First, let us write on the head part of the page.  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfScript:Internal Script</title>
    <script>
      console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- This is how we write an internal script most of the time. Writing the JavaScript code in the body section is the most preferred option. Open the browser console to see the output from the console.log(). -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfScript:Internal Script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!');">Click Me</button>
    <script>
      console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
