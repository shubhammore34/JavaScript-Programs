<!-- Similar to the internal script, the external script link can be on the header or body, but it is preferred to put it in the body. First, we should create an external JavaScript file with .js extension. All files ending with .js extension are JavaScript files. Create a file named introduction.js inside your project directory and write the following code and link this .js file at the bottom of the body.  -->

<!-- External scripts in the head: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfJavaScript:External script</title>
    <script src="introduction.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>

<!-- External scripts in the body: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfJavaScript:External script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- JavaScript external link could be in the header or in the body --> 
    <!-- Before the closing tag of the body is the recommended place to put the external JavaScript script -->
    <script src="introduction.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
